Defensive coding using various libraries
```

I m adding `defensive coding` to a dummy service/repository sample with the following libraries :
- [CodeContracts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/code-contracts) :
a great microsoft library for making preconditions, postconditions and invariants on code but seems to be no maintained (no support for .net core)
- [Pitcher](https://github.com/akamsteeg/Pitcher) :
a small library for throwing a meaningful exception when some condition is not met by code (support for .net core)
- [GuardClauses](https://github.com/ardalis/GuardClauses) :
a nice library for throwing a meaningful exception when some condition is not met by code (support for .net core)
- [LightGuardClauses](https://github.com/feO2x/Light.GuardClauses) :
a rich and user friendly library for throwing a meaningful exception when some condition is not met by code (support for .net core)

**`Tools`** : vs19, net core 3.1, net full 4.7
